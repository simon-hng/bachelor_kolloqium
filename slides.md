- Understanding the grading from instructors and tutors is difficult for student
    - What does this feedback mean? What is the impact on my grade?
- Configuring grading did not reflect the way instructors want to grade exercises
- Overall too time consuming; Instructors where not able to easily create the amount of exercises with
the required amount of information and detail
